Clockvine â€“ Expected API
========================

Clockvine will work for you as long as your API is compatible with the following details. This spec is meant to be fairly generic, works with both craftcms/element-api and Laravel, and is less strict than the JSONAPI spec.

1. First, all responses are **expected to be JSON**.
2. Second, all responses are expected to be a single object, with
3. the primary content stored the `data` attribute of that object, and
4. an optional set of meta information in the `meta` attribute of that object.

The requirements are inspired by JSONAPI, and primarily meant to allow for flexibility in the future.


Expected Endpoints
------------------

A clockvine ApiModule requires two arguments, `baseUrl` and `idProperty`. Based on these, this is what it expects for the following REST actions.

| Action  | Method | URL Format               | Example URL  |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| index   | GET    | `baseUrl`                | /api/users   |
| show    | GET    | `baseUrl`/`id`           | /api/users/1 |
| store   | POST   | `baseUrl`                | /api/users   |
| update  | PUT    | `baseUrl`/`id`           | /api/users/1 |
| destroy | DELETE | `baseUrl`/`id`           | /api/users/1 |


### Expected Endpoints for ElementAPI

For Element API, the default behavior is slightly different. It's assumed that `baseUrl` ends with `.json` and that needs to be stripped off. For the table below, `baseNoSuffix` refers to `baseUrl` with the suffix stripped.

| Action  | Method | URL Format                         | Example URL  |
| ------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------ |
| index   | GET    | `baseUrl`                          | /api/users   |
| show    | GET    | `baseNoSuffix`/`id`.json           | /api/users/1 |
| store   | POST   | `baseUrl`                          | /api/users   |
| update  | PUT    | `baseNoSuffix`/`id`.json           | /api/users/1 |
| destroy | DELETE | `baseNoSuffix`/`id`.json           | /api/users/1 |


### Custom Endpoints

Clockvine also supports customizing the URL formats further, also the actions and methods can't be. The `baseUrl` argument to the ApiModule constructor can be a function, that is passed all parameters, as well as the action as the configurable `actionParameter` (default "action".)


### Even More Custom Endpoints

Beyond customizing the URL formats, You can also provide your own parsing function to Clockvine to handle other response formats. See the [parseResponse configuration option](ApiModule.md) when defining your ApiModule.


### Endpoint Actions

#### INDEX

An index action is a `GET` request to `baseUrl`. The primary content of the
response must be an array of object, with each object representing a single
model for this endpoint.

It's important that each model object here has it's primary key as an attribute, and the name of the primary key field matches `idProperty`. By default, Clockvine will use "id" for `idProperty`, and therefore look for a "id" field on each object.

Example response:
```json
{
  "data": [{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Imarc",
    "email": "info@imarc.com",
    "created_at": "2017-10-27 22:09:36",
    "updated_at": "2017-10-27 22:09:36",
    "phone": null,
    "deleted_at": null,
    "role": "Administrator"
  }, {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Kevin Hamer",
    "email": "kevin+example@imarc.com",
    "created_at": "2017-10-27 22:09:37",
    "updated_at": "2017-10-27 22:09:37",
    "phone": "978 426 8848",
    "deleted_at": null,
    "role": "User"
  }, {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "First Lastername",
    "email": "fake-person@imarc.com",
    "created_at": "2017-10-27 22:09:37",
    "updated_at": "2017-10-27 22:09:37",
    "phone": null,
    "deleted_at": null,
    "role": "User"
  }],
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total_pages": 5
    }
  }
}
```


#### SHOW

A show action is a `GET` request to `baseUrl`/`primary key`, where `primary key` is the primary key of the model you'd like to fetch. The primary content of the response should be a single object representing the model you're fetching.

Just as with index actions, it's important that the primary key is defined within the model.

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Imarc",
  "email": "info@imarc.com",
  "created_at": "2017-10-27 22:09:36",
  "updated_at": "2017-10-27 22:09:36",
  "phone": null,
  "deleted_at": null,
  "role": "Administrator"
}
```


#### STORE

A store action is a `POST` request to `baseUrl` with a payload of just a plain javascript object to store as a new element. The primary content of the response should be the successfully stored element, along with any other properties populated that are normally passed in the API.

Example POST:

```json
{
  "name": "Amesbury",
  "email": "amesbury@imarc.com"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Amesbury",
  "email": "amesbury@imarc.com",
  "created_at": "2020-02-24 22:09:36",
  "updated_at": "2020-02-24 22:09:36",
  "phone": null,
  "deleted_at": null,
  "role": "User"
}
```


#### UPDATE

An update action is a `PUT` request to `baseUrl`/`primary key`, where `primary key` is the primary key of the model you'd like to update. The payload should be an updated element object, although the object does not need to be complete.


#### DESTROY

Finally, a destroy action is a `DELETE` request to `baseUrl`/`primary key`, where `primay key` is the primary key of the model you'd like to delete.
