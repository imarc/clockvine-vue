Clockvine â€“ CollectionComponent
===============================

CollectionComponent is a renderless component meant to be used for a collection of elements. It makes sense for lists, grids and such.


## Using CollectionComponent

The way CollectionComponent works mirrors [ElementComponent](ElementComponent.md). Here's an example using it as a renderless component:

```vue
<collection-component vuex-module="newsArticles" v-slot="{ elements }">
  <div>
    <article v-for="article in elements" :key="article.id">
      ...
    </article>
  </div>
</collection-component>
```

You can also use it as a mixin to one of your own components.


## Nicer Ways to use CollectionComponent

### CollectionComponent.for

The sugariest way to use CollectionComponent is to use `CollectionComponent.for`, a factory method that returns a preconfigured instance of CollectionComponent:

```javascript
components: {
  featuredArticles: CollectionComponent.for('newsArticles')
}
```

The above makes `<featured-articles>` an instance of CollectionComponent that's associated with the `newsArticles` ApiModule (in Vuex) and adds `newsArticles` to the slot scope properties that references the associated elements. In other words, these two are equivalent:

```vue
<featured-articles v-slot="{ newsArticles }">
  ...
</featured-articles>

<collection-component vuex-module="newsArticles" v-slot="{ elements: newsArticles }">
  ...
</collection-component>
```


### CollectionComponent.with

`CollectionComponent.with` is another sugar method for using Clockvine's withHelper with CollectionComponent. For example, let's say I wanted my `<featured-articles>` component to always have the params as `{ featured: true }`:

```
{
  featuredArticles: CollectionComponent.with({
    vuexModule: 'newsArticles',
    params: { featured: true },
    slotParams() {
      return { featuredArticles: this.elements }
    }
  })
}
```

Then these two are equivalent:

```vue
<featured-articles v-slot="{ featuredArticles }">
  ...
</featured-articles>

<collection-component vuex-module="newsArticles" :params="{ featured: true }" v-slot="{ elements: newsArticles }">
  ...
</collection-component>
```


## API

### Props

#### vuexModule

Required; configures the associated Clockvine vuex module (ApiModule).


#### params

Specify parameters for URL building for the associated elements.


#### ignoreParams

Configure parameters to ignore within the `params` object. Both the key and value need to match. This allows for stripping out default parameters from URLs. If the value is a function, then Clockvine will call that function with the current value to determine whether or not to strip out that parameter.


#### requireParams (default false)

If set, no elements will be fetched unless there's at least one non-ignored parameter. Useful for search-result-like pages.


### Methods

#### query

Fetch elements!


### Slot Scope Properties

#### elements (Array)

Associated elements.

#### isLoading (Boolean)

Boolean flag, whether elements are being fetched. Useful for loaders. When this flag changes, the component also `$emit`s a 'isLoading' event with the new value.

#### meta (Object)

Meta information directly from the API response.

#### error (Object)

The current error object, if there was one fetching data from the API, false otherwise.

#### hasError (Boolean)

A sugar version of `error` - literally just `Boolean(this.error)` under the hood.

#### query (Function)

The search query itself for convenience.

#### refresh (Function)

A sugar method that calls query with `mustGet` set `true`.


### Events

#### isLoading

Fired (with a payload of true) when starting to fetch data and again (with a payload of false) when it's done.

#### error

Fired if there's an error returned trying to fetch from the API. The payload for this event is an object containing all the slot scope properties above, so that you can access `error` to get details or do fancier things like call `query` or `refresh` after a timeout.
