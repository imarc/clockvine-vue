Clockvine â€“ ElementComponent
============================

ElementComponent is a renderless component meant to be used with a single Element. It's best used for elements that need to be displayed, updated, and deleted from the front end.

## Using ElementComponent

Please read through the nicer ways to use ElementComonent as well, but the most basic way to use ElementComponent is as a renderless component;

```vue
<element-component vuex-module="someModule" v-slot="{ element }">
    <div>Hello, {{ element.name }}!</div>
</element-component>
```

You can also use it as a mixin:

```
<template>
  <div>Hello, {{ element.name }}!</div>
</template>
<script>
import { ElementComponent } from 'clockvine-vue'

export default {
  mixins: [ ElementComponent ]
}
```


## Nicer Ways to use ElementComponent

### ElementComponent.for

The sugariest way to use ElementComponent is to use `ElementComponent.for`, a factory method that returns an preconfigured instance of ElementComponent:

```javascript
components: {
  exampleThing: ElementComponent.for('someThings')
}
```

The above example makes `<example-thing>` an instance of ElementComponent that's associated with the `someThings` ApiModule (in Vuex) and adds `someThing` to the slot scope properties that references the associated element. In other words, these two are equivalent:

```vue
<example-thing id="3" v-slot="{ someThing }">
  <div>{{ someThing.name }}</div>
</example-thing>

<element-component vuex-module="someThings" v-slot="{ element: someThing }">
  <div>{{ someThing.name }}</div>
</element-component>
```

And you can use `ElementComponent.for` as a mixin too:

```vue
export default {
  mixins: [
    ElementComponent.for('someThings')
  ]
}
```


### ElementComponent.with

`ElementComponent.with` is another sugar method for using Clockvine's withHelper with elementCopmonent for a nicer way to quickly create Elements on the fly. It's mostly useful if you need to override ElementComponent's props or computed properties in a way that you can't using it as a mixin.


## API

### Props

#### vuexModule

Required; configures the associated Clockvine vuex module (ApiModule).


#### params (default `{}`)

Specify parameters for URL building for the associated element.


#### id

The primary key for the associated element.


#### noFetching (default: false)

Disables fetching the associated element if it hasn't been fetched yet. You can use this to delay loading elements.


#### newElement

A function that returns a new object to serve as a new element. This is called if this component is loaded without an id or after storing a new element to reset this element.

### Methods

#### show

Fetch the associated element.


#### store

Stores the associated element as a new element.


#### update

Updates the associated element.


#### destroy

Deletes the associated element.


### Slot Scope Properties

#### element

The associated element. You can use JavaScript's destructuring to change this element too:

```vue
<element-component v-slot="{ element: somethingElse }">
  <div>{{ somethingElse.name }}</div>
</element-component>

<!-- or even the nested destructuring: -->

<element-component v-slot="{ element: { name } }">
  <div>{{ name }}</div>
</element-component>
```


#### refresh

A method exposed to re-fetch (bypasses the cache) the associated element from the API.


#### store

The `store` method exposed to the slot.


#### update

The `update` method exposed to the slot.


#### destroy

The `destroy` method exposed to the slot.
